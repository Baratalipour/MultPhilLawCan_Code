Multiculturalism typically involves the presence and accommodation of diverse cultural, ethnic, and religious groups within a society. However, the passage seems to refer to laws that protect certain rights or privileges related to separate schools and religious instruction, which might imply a historical context where multicultural aspects could be considered, such as the coexistence of different cultural or religious education systems.\n\nSince I cannot derive meaningful labels that encapsulate aspects of multiculturalism directly from the provided text without making broad assumptions, the answer will reflect the lack of direct relevance:\n\n{ \"labels\": [] }\n\nIf the text formed part of a larger discussion on educational provisions for diverse cultural groups in the Northwest Territories, then it might be possible to relate it to multiculturalism. However, based on the given instructions and the fragment provided, there's simply not enough direct information to extract relevant labels tied to multiculturalism."
