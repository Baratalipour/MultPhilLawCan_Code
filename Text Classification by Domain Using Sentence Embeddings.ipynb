      "The demand for recognition in these latter cases is given urgency by the supposed links between recognition and identity, where this latter term designates something like a person’s understanding of who they are, of their fundamental defining characteristics as a human being.\n",
      "Max Similarity Domain: 6.Political Inclusion - \n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Sentence: The thesis is that our identity is partly shaped by recognition or its absence, often by the misrecognition of others, and so a person or group of people can suffer real damage, real distortion, if the people or society around them mirror back to them a confining or demeaning or contemptible picture of themselves.\n",
      "Max Similarity Domain: 1.Cultural Expression - \n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",

      "Max Similarity Domain: 2.Ethical Diversity - \n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Sentence: One way of describing its development is to see its starting point in the eighteenth-century notion that human beings are endowed with a moral sense, an intuitive feeling for what is right and wrong.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Sentence: The idea was that understanding right and wrong was not a matter of dry calculation, but was anchored in our feelings.4 Morality has, in a sense, a voice within.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Sentence: In a sense, it can be seen as just a continuation and intensification of the development inaugurated by Saint Augustine, who saw the road to God as passing through our own self-awareness.\n",

      "Max Similarity Domain: 2.Ethical Diversity - \n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Sentence: I think Rousseau is important not because he inaugurated the change; rather, I would argue that his great popularity comes in part from his articulating something that was in a sense already occurring in the culture.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Sentence: Rousseau frequently presents the issue of morality as that of our following a voice of nature within us.\n",

      "Sentence: Rousseau even gives a name to the intimate contact with oneself, more fundamental than any moral view, that is a source of such joy and contentment: “le sentiment de l’existence.”5\n",
      "29\n",
      "\n",
      "The ideal of authenticity becomes crucial owing to a development that occurs after Rousseau, which I associate with the name of Herder—once again, as its major early articulator, rather than its originator.\n",

      "Max Similarity Domain: 2.Ethical Diversity - \n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Sentence: It accords moral importance to a kind of contact with myself, with my own inner nature, which it sees as in danger of being lost, partly through the pressures toward outward conformity, but also because in taking an instrumental stance toward myself, I may have lost the capacity to listen to this inner voice.\n",
      "Max Similarity Domain: 2.Ethical Diversity - \n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Sentence: It greatly increases the importance of this self-contact by introducing the principle of originality: each of our voices has something unique to say.\n",
